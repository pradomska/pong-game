# pong-game
The famous arcade game. Probably one of the first arcade games that ever was. And it has a really simple premise. It's basically just a ball that's going across a table and two players each control a paddle bouncing the ball back and forth. If you miss the ball, then the other player scores a point.
I've broken this project down into eight pieces. First, I've going to figure out how to create the screen, how to create and move a paddle and then create another paddle so we can have a two-player game and then create the ball and make it move constantly across the screen and figure out when it collides with a wall and make it bounce back and then detect when there's a collision with the paddle to know when to bounce it back. 
Finally, I've figuren out when a user scores, when the paddle misses the ball, and I've kept the score using a scoreboard.
